# RNA-seq analysis in R

Welcome! This workshop takes you through RNA-seq differential gene expression analysis, from intro R to the tidyverse to RNA-seq specific tools. You **do not** need any prior experience in R or coding!

## Outline

* [Setup and installation][lesson0]
* [Intro to R and RStudio][lesson1]
* [Intro to the tidyverse][lesson2]
* [RNA-seq data cleaning][lesson3]
* [Linear modeling][lesson4.1]
* [RNA-seq linear modeling][lesson4.2]

See the workshop schedule times [here](outline.md).

## Instructors

[Kim Dill-McFarland, PhD](https://kdillmcfarland.github.io/) is a Senior Bioinformatician in the Div of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the U of Washington. Kim leads a team of bioinformaticians who use sequencing and other high-throughput techniques to research how the human immune system responds to diseases like tuberculosis, asthma, and COVID. Kim has been coding in R for more than 10 years and taught R as an Instructor at the U of British Columbia as well as volunteer for the Carpentries and RLadies.
